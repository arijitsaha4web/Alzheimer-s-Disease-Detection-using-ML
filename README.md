# Alzheimer-s-Disease-Detection-using-ML
Using Handwritten dataset
**Overview:**
This project aims to detect Alzheimer's Disease (AD) using machine learning techniques. The model developed achieves an accuracy of 94% using the ExtraTree Classifier. Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive neurological disorder that leads to memory loss, cognitive decline, and eventually loss of ability to carry out simple tasks. Early detection is crucial for timely intervention and management of the disease.
**Features:**
High Accuracy: The model achieves a 94% accuracy rate.
Machine Learning Techniques: Utilizes the ExtraTree Classifier for detection.
Data Preprocessing: Includes steps for handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
Easy to Use: Simple and straightforward implementation.
